OpenMFL
============
The Open Multi-Function Library for .NET

OpenMFL (or as it was previously called, DCS Multi-function DLL) is a .NET-based class library 
 containing a wide range of functions that are not already available or not easily implemented 
 within .NET already.

The majority of the code within OpenMFL is written in VB.NET, and is not very well structured. 
The project was started around 2009 and was originally a hobby, with the sole purpose of 
containing re-usable code for use within other projects easily. 

Many classes within the library have been unknowingly contributed to by many kind forum users 
over the years, with code that they have posted in the public domain in response to other 
peoples (and indeed my own) .NET coding questions.

The project is now over 4 years old, and after seeing a period of little to no maintenance or 
use, it has finally been re-born in 2014 under the new name of "OpenMFL". Since then, the code 
is now licensed under the GNU GPLv3 to protect the efforts of both myself and the many others 
who have helped by ensuring that our code remains Open-Source for the world to use, re-use, 
and modify as they please, while encouraging Open-Source projects to be built upon this. The 
project was closed-source before this, although it was never used or distributed in any 
projects.

Feel free to use any or part of this library (in accordance with the license, of course), 
Likewise feel free to correct, add to, and tidy up this library - Merge requests are accepted 
and appreciated.
